        <h1>Designer</h1>
        <p>My name is Imelda Guzman and I'm a certified Web Content Developer and Designer creating quality, functional designs for clients looking to expand and market their business.</p>
        <p>I was accepted to Sonoma State University in 2005 and pursued an education in the Arts while exposing myself to opportunities in the field. I graduated with high academic scores and obtained a Bachelors degree in Art Studio with an emphasis in painting.</p>
        <p>Following graduation, I decided to stay in Sonoma County and take up permanent residency in Santa Rosa as an active community member involved in Web social groups and conferences.</p>
        <p>Designer and cofounder of Three Piece Design, a local web design company, I design websites using my creative talent to meet the needs of established and future clients.</p>
